# SaaS client template

<p align="center">
    The starter for the frontend of an InfinitiBit SaaS Application. It handles Sessions, the API proxy, Brands, translations and list Screens, so a new Application only adds its own Screens.

## Overview

Each InfinitiBit Application is a Service, its own backend, plus the client in front of it. This template is the client, with everything every Application's client shares already built.

[`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) defines the capitalised terms used here, such as Application, Service, Mode, Launch and Session.

### Key features

- **SaaS and Standalone Modes from one build.** With `APP_MODE=saas`, the Tenant portal Launches the user and the client calls the Service directly. With `APP_MODE=standalone`, the user signs in through gt and the client reaches the Service through gt's Facade.
- **HttpOnly Session.** The browser removes the Launch credentials from the address bar before the router starts, and the server keeps them in `__Host-` cookies that no script can read.
- **Server-rendered Session gate.** A visitor without a Session gets the sign-in card in the first response and never sees the Application.
- **Two Brands.** A deployment wears `default` or `gt`, chosen at runtime and set separately from the Mode.
- **English and German.** Paraglide translates the copy, and the locale lives in a cookie, never in the URL.
- **Generated API client.** orval generates TanStack Query hooks and MSW mocks from the Service's OpenAPI spec.
- **List Screens.** One `DataTable` draws every list and keeps its page, size and search in the URL.

## Architecture and philosophy

Code a feature owns lives in that feature. Route files stay thin and import their behaviour. [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr) records each architecture decision in its own file.

### Feature-based structure

```
src/
├── routes/             # Thin TanStack file-based routes
├── features/
│   ├── api/            # The /api proxy, the axios mutator and the generated client
│   ├── auth/           # Launch, Session cookies, sign-in and the Session gate
│   ├── brand/          # Reads APP_BRAND for the root document
│   ├── shell/          # The frame around every Screen
│   └── notes/          # The example feature, to replace
├── components/         # Components more than one feature uses (DataTable, ListSearch)
├── testing/            # MSW server and the render and request helpers for tests
├── application.ts      # This Application's name and Facade prefix
└── env.server.ts       # Reads and validates the server's environment
messages/               # en.json and de.json
docs/adr/               # Architecture decision records
```

Server-only modules end in `.server.ts` and live in the feature that owns them.

### Styling strategy

- **Components.** Build every Screen from [`@infinitibit_gmbh/ui`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@infinitibit_gmbh/ui). Do not copy shadcn components or add another component library.
- **Tokens.** Colour, spacing, radius, shadow and type come only from the design system's `--ib-*` tokens, through the Tailwind theme in `src/styles.css`. `pnpm lint` rejects raw colours, arbitrary values and restyled components.
- **Icons.** Use only the design system's `<Icon>`.

### State management

- **Server state.** TanStack Query holds it all. Screens call the generated hooks directly and invalidate by the generated key prefix. [`docs/agents/data-fetching.md`](docs/agents/data-fetching.md) has the details.
- **List state.** A list's page, size and search live in the URL through `listSearchSchema` and `ListSearch`.
- **UI state.** Components keep it in local React state.

### API integration

The browser calls the Service's own paths under `/api` in both Modes. The same-origin proxy at `/api` is the only code that knows the Mode. It forwards only the tags listed in `FORWARDED_TAGS` in `src/features/api/lib/api.ts`, adds the Facade prefix in Standalone, and renews the Session once on a `401`.

orval reads [`openapi.yaml`](openapi.yaml), or the file or URL in `API_SPEC`, and generates one hook per operation, named from its summary. `List Notes` becomes `useListNotes`. Never edit `src/features/api/generated/`. Run `pnpm api:generate` instead.

### Authentication

- **SaaS.** The Tenant portal Launches the user onto `/<tenant-slug>#token=…&refresh_token=…`. Platform Auth renews and revokes the Session.
- **Standalone.** The sign-in card sends the user to gt, which returns them to `/auth/callback` with the same fragment. gt renews the Session.
- **Session.** The browser posts the fragment to `/session`, and the server stores it in `__Host-` HttpOnly cookies. The server decides between the Session gate and the Application before it renders anything.

### Routing

- Routes are TanStack Router files in `src/routes/`.
- Every Application Screen sits under the pathless `_authenticated` layout, which holds the Session gate.
- The arrival routes, `/$tenantSlug` and `/auth/callback`, stay outside it.
- The locale never appears in the URL, because the tenant slug already takes the first path segment.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22
- pnpm at the version pinned in `packageManager`. `corepack enable` installs it.

### Installation

1.  **Create the repository** with **Use this template** on GitHub, then clone it.

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

3.  **Set up the environment.** Copy the example for your Mode to `.env`:

    ```bash
    cp .env.saas.example .env        # or .env.standalone.example
    ```

    | Variable            | Mode       | Purpose                                                                                                             |
    | ------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `APP_MODE`          | both       | `saas` or `standalone`. Required. The server refuses to start without it.                                           |
    | `APP_BRAND`         | both       | `default` or `gt`. Any other value falls back to `default`.                                                         |
    | `PORT`              | both       | The port the dev and built servers listen on.                                                                       |
    | `HOST_PORT`         | both       | The host port compose publishes the container on.                                                                   |
    | `TENANT_PORTAL_URL` | SaaS       | Where the client sends a visitor with no Session to be Launched.                                                    |
    | `PLATFORM_AUTH_URL` | SaaS       | Where the proxy renews a Session and where sign-out revokes it.                                                     |
    | `SERVICE_URL`       | SaaS       | The Service that `/api` forwards to. If it is unset, `/api` answers `501`.                                          |
    | `GT_SERVER_URL`     | Standalone | The gt server. gt must list this Application in its `SSO_APP_RETURN_URIS`, or sign-in fails with `SSO_APP_UNKNOWN`. |

    The server reads these at runtime and none of them reach the browser, so one image serves every Mode and Brand.

4.  **Make it your Application:**
    - Replace `saas-client-template` everywhere with the Application's name. It names the package, the compose service, the Session cookies and the Facade prefix in [`src/application.ts`](src/application.ts). gt chooses the Facade prefix, so confirm it with gt.
    - Replace `openapi.yaml` with the Service's spec, list the Service's tags in `FORWARDED_TAGS`, and run `pnpm api:generate`. Every operation needs a `summary`.
    - Build your Screens under `src/features/<feature>/`, using `src/features/notes/` as the example, then delete it.
    - Add your own domain terms to `CONTEXT.md`.

### Running locally

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The app runs at `http://localhost:3000`.

`pnpm dev` answers the Service's paths from MSW in the browser, so the example Notes list works with no Service running. To Launch yourself, open `http://localhost:3000/dev#token=dev.dev.dev`. The client checks only the token's shape and the mocked Service checks nothing, so you land signed in. The account menu shows no Identity, because the Identity comes from the real Service.

### Running with Docker

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

The Dockerfile builds in two stages on Node 22 and runs `.output/server/index.mjs` as a non-root user, with a health check on `/`. Compose joins the external `ib-saas-platform_default` network, so start the platform first.

## Available scripts

| Script              | Description                                                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm dev`          | Start the dev server with the MSW-backed Service               |
| `pnpm build`        | Build for production into `.output/`                           |
| `pnpm start`        | Serve the build, reading `.env` if it exists                   |
| `pnpm test`         | Run the tests once with Vitest                                 |
| `pnpm lint`         | Run type-aware oxlint, including the design-system token rules |
| `pnpm format`       | Format with oxfmt                                              |
| `pnpm format:check` | Check formatting without writing                               |
| `pnpm type:check`   | Compile the messages, then run `tsc`                           |
| `pnpm api:generate` | Regenerate `src/features/api/generated/` from the OpenAPI spec |
| `pnpm commit`       | Commit with Commitizen                                         |

## Testing

MSW stubs every upstream, and a request that no test declared fails the test. Tests enter the client in one of two ways:

- Call a server route with a `Request` and check the `Response`, using `respond()` from [`src/testing/respond.ts`](src/testing/respond.ts).
- Render the real router at an address with `renderRouter()` from [`src/testing/render-router.tsx`](src/testing/render-router.tsx).

Mock the Service over HTTP, never the hooks. `holdSession()` from `src/testing/session.ts` gives a test a Session.

## Workflows

- **CI.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the lint, format, type and test checks and a build. Start it by hand from the Actions tab.
- **Release.** `.github/workflows/release.yml` runs semantic-release on every push to `main`.

## Contributing

Work moves from `dev` to `stage` to `main`. `dev` is the default branch.

1.  Branch from `dev` as `type/scope/slug`, such as `feat/notes/create-dialog`.
2.  Run the checks: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format:check`, `pnpm type:check`, `pnpm test`.
3.  Commit with Conventional Commits. `pnpm commit` prompts for one, and commitlint rejects any other message.
4.  Push the branch and open a pull request against `dev`. A squash merge turns the pull request title into the commit, so write the title as a Conventional Commit.

### Releases

- Promote `dev` to `stage` for testing, and `stage` to `main` to release. Promote with a merge commit, never a squash, because semantic-release reads the individual commits.
- `main` holds releases only. semantic-release reads the Conventional Commits since the last tag, and when one calls for a release it tags the version and publishes a GitHub release with the notes. The GitHub releases are the changelog. `fix` makes a patch, `feat` a minor and a `BREAKING CHANGE` footer a major. Other types release nothing.
- A hotfix branches from `main` as `fix/scope/slug` and merges into `main`. Once semantic-release publishes it, merge `main` into `stage` and `stage` into `dev`, so every branch gets the fix.

### Git hooks

- `pre-commit` runs `pnpm lint-staged`, which lints and formats the staged files.
- `commit-msg` runs commitlint on the message.
- `pre-push` rejects a branch name that is not `main`, `stage`, `dev` or `type/scope/slug`.
